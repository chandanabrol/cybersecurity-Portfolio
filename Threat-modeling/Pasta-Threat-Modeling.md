# PASTA Threat Modeling – Course 5

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the use of the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework to evaluate security risks in a sneaker marketplace mobile application.

The application processes user authentication, financial transactions, API communications, and SQL database operations.

## Threats Identified
- SQL Injection
- Session Hijacking

## Vulnerabilities Identified
- Lack of prepared statements
- Weak API authentication/token validation

## Security Controls Recommended
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
- Encryption (AES + PKI)
- Input validation

## Skills Demonstrated
- Threat modeling
- Risk analysis
- Vulnerability assessment
- Security architecture review
