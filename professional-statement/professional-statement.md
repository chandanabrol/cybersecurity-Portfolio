I have completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications with a CGPA of 8.26 and am at the early stage of my professional journey in cybersecurity. My interest in this field, particularly ethical hacking, developed through exposure to movies and real-life scenarios where cybersecurity professionals protect organizations by identifying vulnerabilities and preventing data breaches. These situations sparked my curiosity about how systems function internally and how information can be manipulated or secured.

From a young age, I have been interested in understanding how technology works behind the scenes. I was especially curious about how game modifications are created and how data within systems can be altered. Over time, this curiosity matured into a strong interest in cybersecurity and system security. To build a solid technical foundation, I have started learning Kali Linux, Python, and networking fundamentals, and I am actively developing my skills through structured coursework, hands-on practice, and consistent self-study.

As a beginner in cybersecurity, I am honest about my current experience level, but I am highly committed to learning and professional growth. I follow a disciplined learning routine, regularly practice concepts, and maintain detailed notes to ensure a clear understanding of security principles rather than surface-level knowledge. I believe this consistent and methodical approach aligns well with professional environments that value accuracy, responsibility, and continuous improvement.

I am naturally introverted and quiet, but I am focused, observant, and curious when learning new technologies. I prefer to understand systems deeply and analyze problems carefully before attempting solutions. I am seeking an entry-level cybersecurity analyst role where I can gain exposure to real-world security incidents, continue developing my technical skills, and contribute responsibly to protecting systems, data, and organizational assets in a professional and international work environment.
