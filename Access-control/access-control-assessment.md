## Access Control Assessment – Authorization and Authentication

Reviewed an access control incident involving unauthorized payroll access by a former contractor. Analyzed event logs, identified failures in authorization controls, and recommended improvements to prevent future misuse of privileged accounts.

**Key findings:**
- Former contractor retained admin access
- No access revocation after contract termination
- Sensitive payroll systems lacked strong authentication controls

**Recommendations implemented:**
- Automatic account deactivation after employment ends
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for financial systems

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Access log analysis
- Authorization and authentication review
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Security mitigation planning
