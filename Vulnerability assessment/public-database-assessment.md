Conducted a qualitative vulnerability assessment of a publicly accessible remote database server used by an e-commerce company. Identified significant threat sources and evaluated risk using likelihood and severity scoring based on NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 guidance.

**Key Risks Identified:**
- Data exfiltration by external attackers
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Unauthorized data modification by insiders

**Security Concepts Applied:**
- Risk scoring (Likelihood × Severity)
- Qualitative assessment methodology
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

**Remediation Focus:**
- Remove public access to database
- Implement RBAC and MFA
- Enable logging and monitoring
- Encrypt sensitive data
