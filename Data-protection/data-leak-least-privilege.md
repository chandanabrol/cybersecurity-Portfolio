Analyzed a data leak caused by excessive access permissions and failure to revoke shared access. Reviewed how the principle of least privilege applies to data handling and evaluated improvements using NIST SP 800-53: AC-6.

**Key focus areas:**
- Identifying causes of accidental data leaks
- Applying least privilege to information access
- Reviewing NIST SP 800-53 access control guidance
- Recommending control enhancements for data privacy

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Data risk analysis
- Least privilege evaluation
- Security control assessment
- Writing security justifications
