### Networking and IT Fundamentals
- **Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking** – Google  
  This course helped me understand the basics of computer networking, including how data travels across networks, common networking devices, protocols, IP addressing, and basic troubleshooting concepts. It gave me a strong foundation in networking, which is essential for understanding security issues in real-world environments.

### Google Cybersecurity Certificate
- **Foundations of Cybersecurity** – Google  
  This course introduced core cybersecurity concepts such as security principles, common threats, risk awareness, and the responsibilities of cybersecurity professionals. It helped me understand how organizations work to protect systems, networks, and sensitive data.

- **Play It Safe: Manage Threats and Risks** – Google  
  This course focused on understanding how organizations identify security risks and manage threats before incidents occur. I learned how to evaluate assets, recognize vulnerabilities, and assess risk using structured approaches. The course introduced security controls, control categories, and compliance concepts such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC. Through a simulated security audit scenario, I practiced reviewing an organization’s security posture, identifying missing controls, and recommending practical improvements to reduce risk.

- **Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security** – Google  
  This course focused on how networks operate and how they can be protected from common security threats. I learned about network protocols, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and secure network design. Through hands-on activities, I analyzed network traffic, identified network-based attacks such as denial-of-service incidents, and practiced applying network hardening techniques to improve security and reduce risk.

- **Tools of the Trade: Linux and SQL** – Google  
  This course focused on using Linux and SQL as core tools for cybersecurity analysis. I learned how to manage file and directory permissions using Linux commands such as `ls -la` and `chmod` to enforce proper authorization. I also used SQL queries with filters like AND, OR, NOT, and LIKE to investigate login activity and retrieve employee data for security-related tasks. These activities helped me understand how operating systems and databases are used in real-world security investigations.

- **Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities** – Google
  This course focused on identifying, analyzing, and managing cybersecurity risks within an organization. I learned how to conduct risk assessments using risk registers, evaluate vulnerabilities using frameworks like NIST SP 800-30, and apply access control principles such as least privilege. I performed threat modeling using the PASTA framework, analyzed USB baiting and data leak scenarios, and assessed security controls to mitigate potential attacks. These activities strengthened my ability to evaluate security posture, prioritize risks, and recommend practical security controls to reduce organizational exposure.
