# Wireshark vs tcpdump Comparison – Course 6

## Wireshark
- Uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Advanced filtering and colorized packet inspection
- Deep protocol decoding
- Requires more system resources
- Ideal for detailed forensic analysis

## tcpdump
- Uses a Command-Line Interface (CLI)
- Lightweight and efficient
- Uses Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) syntax
- Suitable for remote servers and headless systems
- Common during live incident response

## Similarities
- Both are network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers)
- Both are open-source and free
- Both capture and analyze network traffic in real time
- Both support protocol/IP/port filtering
- Both are used in troubleshooting and security investigations

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network traffic analysis understanding
- Tool comparison and evaluation
- Incident response tool selection
- Packet capture fundamentals
